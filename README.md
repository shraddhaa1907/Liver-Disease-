Liver Disease Prediction using Random Forest
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting liver disease using machine learning techniques. A Random Forest classifier is used to analyze medical attributes and classify whether a patient is likely to have liver disease or not.

Early prediction can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis and decision-making.

🎯 Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict liver disease

Use Random Forest for accurate classification

Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

🗂 Dataset
The dataset contains medical records with attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Total Bilirubin

Direct Bilirubin

Alkaline Phosphotase
